//wishlistpriority=[1-5]	Filter for wishlist priority. Returns only items of the specified priority.

//minrating=[1-10]	Filter on minimum personal rating assigned for that item in the collection.
//rating=[1-10]	Filter on maximum personal rating assigned for that item in the collection. [Note: Although you'd expect it to be maxrating, it's rating.]
//minbggrating=[1-10]	Filter on minimum BGG rating for that item in the collection. Note: 0 is ignored... you can use -1 though, for example min -1 and max 1 to get items w/no bgg rating.
//bggrating=[1-10]	Filter on maximum BGG rating for that item in the collection. [Note: Although you'd expect it to be maxbggrating, it's bggrating.]

//minplays=NNN	Filter by minimum number of recorded plays.
//maxplays=NNN	Filter by maximum number of recorded plays. [Note: Although the two maxima parameters above lack the max part, this one really is maxplays.]

//showprivate=1	Filter to show private collection info. Only works when viewing your own collection and you are logged in.

//collid=NNN	Restrict the collection results to the single specified collection id. Collid is returned in the results of normal queries as well.

//modifiedsince=YY-MM-DD	Restricts the collection results to only those whose status (own, want, fortrade, etc.) has changed or been added since the date specified (does not return results for deletions). Time may be added as well: modifiedsince=YY-MM-DD%20HH:MM:SS
